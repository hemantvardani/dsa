trying to put some solution of DSA popular question 

here in  dp 

1). Knapsack prooblem 
     a.)fractional k...  (by greedy)
     b.) o-1 k.....    
                     optimized - by dp  in time complexity of O(N*W)
                                here two ways with space complexity either O(N*W) or O(W).
                                
    c.) unbounded k.....    
                     optimized - by dp  in time complexity of O(N*W)
                                here two ways with space complexity either O(N*W)ie 2d table or O(W) ie 1D table for storage.
                                
                                
2).  subset sum problem
        
        
        here
